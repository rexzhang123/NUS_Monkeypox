# NUS_Monkeypox

Welcome to the `NUS_Monkeypox` project repository. This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Twitter data related to the 2022 Monkeypox outbreak, using a dataset compiled from Nirmalya Thakur's original dataset _MonkeyPox2022Tweets_.

## Dataset

The `combinedTweetIDs.csv` file is the cornerstone of this analysis. It's a compiled dataset from Nirmalya Thakur's original dataset titled _MonkeyPox2022Tweets: The First Public Twitter Dataset on the 2022 MonkeyPox Outbreak_. This dataset includes Tweet IDs which can be used to study and analyze public sentiment regarding the Monkeypox outbreak on Twitter.

## Sentiment Analysis

The sentiment analysis is performed in two files:

- **monkeypoxTwitter.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that walks through the sentiment analysis process in a step-by-step, interactive manner.
- **monkeypoxtwitter.py**: A Python script version of the analysis, suitable for running as a standalone script.

Both files include comprehensive analysis workflows starting from data preprocessing to sentiment analysis using various methodologies.
